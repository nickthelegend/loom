**The shared-memory layer for AI dev environments.** Every coding agent — Claude Code,
OpenCode, Antigravity, Codex, … — keeps its own brain in its own files. Loom makes them
**one brain**: connect your ADEs, and their memory, decisions, and context become a
single shared thread that flows from one agent to the next.

Loom is **not** another IDE. It's the thin layer *between* your agents — the continuity
and memory they don't share on their own.

## Why

Every coding agent keeps its own brain. Claude Code's memory can't be read by
OpenCode; Antigravity doesn't know what you decided with Claude an hour ago. Switch
tools and you re-explain your project every time.

Other multi-agent tools answer this by keeping agents **apart** — each in its own
worktree, run in parallel, compare and merge. Loom makes the opposite bet: keep the
agents' **memory together** so work *continues* across them instead of forking.

- **One brain across every ADE** — Loom imports each agent's native memory
  (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, …) into a unified store, merges it with your decisions and
  the shared thread, and hands the whole thing to whoever picks up next. `loom memory`.
- **The baton** — exactly one agent works at a time; passing it *carries the context*
  (interrupt-safe, memory projected, briefing armed). Not isolation — continuation.
- **Routes** — let Loom drive the chain: `loom route ship "add dark mode"` runs
  plan → execute → review as one command, the brain flowing hop to hop; or `loom route
  auto` lets an LLM pick each next agent.
- **Every surface, one daemon** — a full-screen TUI, a web app, a desktop window, and a
  phone app (voice input, per-prompt diffs, push) — each a paired client of the same
  local daemon over your tailnet.
- **Local-first & yours** — one `npm i -g`, no account, MIT, runs headless on a server.

## Install

Requires **Node ≥ 22.5** (Loom's event log uses the built-in `node:sqlite`).

```bash
npm install -g threadloom          # → `loom` on your PATH
```

Other paths:

```bash
# one-liner from source (clones ~/.loom-src, builds, links; re-run to update)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickthelegend/loom/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# straight from git
npm install -g github:nickthelegend/loom

# hackable checkout
git clone https://github.com/nickthelegend/loom.git && cd loom
npm install && npm run build && npm link
```

Then verify the setup:

```bash
loom doctor        # checks node, agents, tailscale, daemon, and your project
```

Surfaces, all talking to the same daemon:
- **TUI / CLI** — `loom` (default), `loom chat`, `loom send`, …
- **Desktop app** — [`desktop/`](desktop/README.md): `cd desktop && npm install && npm
  start` opens a native Electron window (starts the daemon and pairs itself) on the
  workspace below.
- **Phone app** — [`app/`](app/README.md): `cd app && npx expo install && npx expo start`,
  scan with Expo Go (voice input, per-prompt diffs, push).
- **Web app** — no install; `loom pair` → open the link. Same workspace in the browser.

## The workspace

On a wide screen the web app (and the desktop shell around it) is a full workspace for
*driving* agents — still not an editor: Loom shows you the context and the agents do
the writing.

```

- **Projects + agents** in the left rail; click an agent to aim your next message at it.
- **Thread** is the shared conversation; **Brain** is the unified memory; **Board**
  is everything in flight.
- **Board** is four columns — working → needs you → in review → ready to merge —
  built from real state: which agents are running or blocked (ours), and what
  GitHub says about each PR (draft, CI failed, changes requested, approved),
  read through your own `gh`. Drag a card and it stays where you put it, but the
  badge keeps telling the truth: a drag can't approve a review or turn CI green.
  Each card wears its agent's own logo.
- **Click any change** — an `Update(n files)` card, or a file in Source Control — and the
  diff opens to the right of the chat. It stays closed until you ask for it.
- **Explorer / Search / Source Control / Tasks** in the right panel; every column is
  drag-resizable (double-click a handle to reset).
- **Terminal** (`Ctrl` + `` ` ``) is a real terminal in the project directory — a
  proper pty, so the shell draws its own prompt and `vim`, `less`, `htop`, `^C`
  and `^Z` all behave. `node-pty` is optional: without it (Linux with no build
  toolchain) you get a pipe-backed shell instead, where `cd` and variables still
  persist and `^C` still works, driven a line at a time.
- **Tasks** lists the repo's open issues and PRs — filters, GitHub's own search
  syntax, real label colours — and **Start** on a row drafts a task from that
  issue. It reads through your own `gh` CLI, so Loom never asks for a token; if
  `gh` is missing, signed out, or the project has no GitHub remote, it says so.
- **New task** (`n`) picks a project, a task, and **one agent — or several**, which run
  it as a pipeline, hop to hop. **New project** (`p`) adds a repo — a native folder
  picker in the desktop app — and reports which ADEs it found on the host.

## Quickstart

```bash
cd your-project
loom init          # detects installed agents (claude, opencode), assigns roles
loom               # opens the TUI — one full-screen thread over every agent
```

```
  ██      ▄████▄  ▄████▄  ▄█▄▄█▄
  ██      ██  ██  ██  ██  ██▀▀██
  ██      ██  ██  ██  ██  ██  ██
  ██████  ▀████▀  ▀████▀  ██  ██
        one thread · every agent

  10:44 claude-code  here's the plan: …
   ⟶ baton: claude-code → opencode
  10:45 opencode     implementing step 1 …

 ╭──────────────────────────────────────────────╮
 │ › Ask anything… "/route ship: add dark mode" │
 │ opencode · executor ⟵ baton                  │
 ╰──────────────────────────────────────────────╯
   tab shift agent · /help · esc interrupt        loom 0.1.0
   ~ my-project · baton opencode  ➤ ship 2/3
```

**`tab` shifts the active agent/IDE** — claude-code → opencode → back. The handoff
(interrupt-safe, memory projected, briefing armed) happens when you hit enter, so
switching is one keystroke, not a ceremony. **`ctrl+p` opens the command palette**
(fuzzy-filtered: shift to any agent, launch a named route, decision, interrupt, pair…).
`esc` interrupts, `/help` lists the slash commands.

Prefer plain line-mode (SSH, scripts)? `loom chat` is the same thread as a classic REPL,
and every action also exists as a one-shot command (`loom send`, `loom handoff`, …).

## Routing — multi-hop pipelines

Handoffs are unlimited and manual by default. **Routes** automate a chain of them:

```bash
loom route auto "add a dark-mode toggle"          # DYNAMIC: an LLM picks each hop
loom route ship "add a dark-mode toggle"          # named pipeline from config
loom route planner,executor "fix the flaky test"  # ad-hoc: roles…
loom route claude-code,opencode,claude-code "…"   # …or agent ids, any length
```

**`auto` is dynamic routing**: after every hop, a router looks at the task, the hop
history, and the last replies, then picks the next agent — or declares the task done.
The router is Claude (headless, small model, JSON out) with a deterministic
plan→execute→review rules engine as automatic fallback, so routes never stall on a
router failure. Every decision is logged with its reason
(`➤ hop 2 → opencode (plan ready — execute it)`), a hop budget caps runaways
(`--max-hops`, default 8), and `--router rules` skips the LLM entirely.

What happens per hop: interrupt-safe **handoff** → shared-memory **projection** →
**briefing** → the step's role instruction. Then:

- step finishes cleanly → Loom advances to the next agent automatically;
- the agent asks a question → the route **pauses** (`waiting_human`), you get a
  notification, `loom route --status` and the board show the question; you answer in
  the shared thread (`loom send "…"`) and the route **resumes by itself**;
- an agent errors or a step times out (45 min default) → the route fails loudly;
- **you always outrank the route**: any manual `handoff`/`interrupt` cancels it, and
  `loom route --abort` stops it and interrupts the in-flight turn.

`--detach` returns immediately (fire-and-notify); following with Ctrl-C also leaves the
route running server-side. One route per project at a time (the baton is one write
lock); run routes across *different* projects in parallel freely.

Define named pipelines in `.loom/config.json` — steps are roles or agent ids, and any
step can carry its own focus:

```json
"routes": {
  "ship": ["planner", "executor", "reviewer"],
  "api-only": [
    { "step": "planner",  "instruction": "design the endpoint contract only" },
    { "step": "executor", "instruction": "only touch src/api — no schema changes" },
    "reviewer"
  ]
}
```

Per-step instructions are appended to the role guidance for exactly that step — the
next hop never sees them. `loom init` seeds a `ship` route automatically when it
detects at least two roles.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `loom` | **The TUI** — full-screen thread, `tab` shifts agents, `/`-commands inline |
| `loom init` | Make the current directory a Loom project (auto-detects agents) |
| `loom chat` | Same thread as a plain line REPL (`/handoff`, `/interrupt`, `@agent`) |
| `loom send <text>` | One-shot message (`-a <agent>` to address someone specific) |
| `loom handoff <agent>` | Pass the baton — interrupts, projects memory, briefs the target |
| `loom route <spec> "<task>"` | Run a pipeline (name, or `a,b,c` ids/roles); `--status` / `--abort` / `--detach` |
| `loom routes` | List named pipelines defined for this project |
| `loom interrupt` | Stop the current holder's turn (cancels an active route) |
| `loom decision <text>` | Record a decision into shared memory |
| `loom memory [import]` | The unified brain — one memory across every connected ADE |
| `loom log [-f]` | Show (or follow) the project event log |
| `loom costs` | Project spend: total + per-agent turns, $ and agent time |
| `loom agents` / `loom projects` / `loom status` | Who's who, board of projects, daemon health |
| `loom up [--tailnet] [--restart]` / `loom down` / `loom daemon` | Daemon lifecycle (`--tailnet` binds to your Tailscale IP) |
| `loom pair` | QR deep link that pairs a phone (single-use token) |
| `loom clients [--revoke <id>] [--ping]` | Paired devices: list, revoke, or send a test push |
| `loom doctor` | Diagnose env, daemon, binding, and project config — with fixes |

## Supported agents

| Agent | Tier | Transport | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | adapter (full-duplex) | headless CLI, `stream-json`, `--resume`, briefing via `--append-system-prompt` | ✅ verified against 2.1.83 |
| OpenCode | adapter (full-duplex) | `opencode serve` HTTP + SSE (`/prompt`, `/interrupt`, `/event`) | ✅ verified against 1.17.20 |
| Echo | adapter (demo/tests) | in-process | ✅ |
| Antigravity | **bridge** (read-mostly) | Chromium debug port — presence + memory projections only | 🔶 experimental |

**Adapters** implement the full contract (send / stream / injectMemory / interrupt /
diff) and may hold the baton. **Bridges** only observe and receive shared-memory
projections — they never hold the write lock. That's a design decision, not a gap: GUI
agents without a stable API can't be trusted with interrupt-safe writes. See
[docs/integration-notes.md](docs/integration-notes.md) for the verified surfaces.

## How it works

- **Event log** (`.loom/log.db`, SQLite via `node:sqlite`, JSONL fallback) — every
  message, tool call, file edit, decision, and handoff, appended in order. The log *is*
  the project's memory; everything else is a view of it.
- **Projection** — on handoff, Loom distills the log into
  `.loom/memory/<agent>.md` (persistent, namespaced) and arms a short one-shot briefing
  injected with the target's next turn (system-prompt append for Claude Code, delimited
  preamble for OpenCode). Two renderers behind one interface:
  - **template** (default) — deterministic, instant, free;
  - **llm** — a small Claude model distills the recent log into a dense doc
    (mission / current state / decisions / risks / next moves). Opt in per project:
    `"projection": { "mode": "llm", "model": "haiku" }`. Any failure or timeout falls
    back to the template — a broken Claude never blocks a handoff. Bridges always get
    template views (no N×LLM waste per hop).
- **Baton** — persisted per project (`.loom/state.json`). Messages route to the holder;
  addressing a non-holder returns `409 not_holder` and the surface asks you to confirm a
  handoff. Ghost holders (agent removed from config) self-heal. Every handoff snapshots
  the outgoing agent's working-tree state (dirty flag + `git status`) into the log.
- **Unified memory ("multiple memory in one")** — each connected ADE keeps its own
  native memory (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, …). Loom imports them all into one brain
  (`memory_import` events, content-hash deduped), merges them with the project's
  decisions and shared thread, and projects the union into whoever holds the baton.
  Connect a new agent → its knowledge joins the brain, and everything the others learned
  flows into it. `loom memory` shows the merged brain; it refreshes on open and on every
  handoff. This is the seam an isolation-first tool (separate worktrees) can't own.
- **Decisions** — `loom decision <text>` pins a fact, and any agent line starting
  `Decision: …` is captured automatically. Decisions ride every future projection.
- **Cost telemetry** — agents that report per-turn cost (Claude Code, OpenCode) feed a
  live ledger: `loom costs` breaks it down per agent, the board/TUI/phone app show the
  project total, and every route logs exactly what it spent
  (`✔ route completed (3 steps) · $0.0421`). Totals rehydrate from the event log, so
  they survive restarts.
- **Daemon** — one process, many projects. REST for commands, WebSocket for the live
  stream. Config edits hot-reload when the project is quiet.

## Your phone (Android today, over Tailscale)

The daemon serves a full phone app at `/app` — board, live thread, agent chips, routes.
No app store, no build step; it ships inside Loom.

```bash
loom up --tailnet     # daemon binds to your Tailscale IP (never 0.0.0.0)
loom pair             # QR appears in the terminal
```

Scan the QR with your phone camera (phone must be on your tailnet — install the
Tailscale app and sign in). The link opens `…/app#pair=<token>`; the app claims the
**single-use, 10-minute** pairing token from the URL fragment (fragments never hit the
network log) and exchanges it for its own client token. Then:

- **Board** — every project, needs-input dots, baton holder, live route progress.
- **Thread** — the same shared conversation, streaming over WebSocket.
- **Agent chips** — tap `opencode`, hit send: baton shifts (projection + briefing
  included), exactly like `tab` in the TUI.
- **Routes** — the ➤ button opens a picker: choose **auto** (LLM picks each hop), any
  named pipeline, or custom steps, type the task, go. Live banner with hop progress and
  reasons, an abort button, and when a route pauses on a question you answer right
  there and it resumes.
- Chrome menu → *Add to Home screen* installs it like an app.

**Push notifications** come with the native app ([`app/`](app/README.md)): open it once
after pairing and it registers its Expo push token with the daemon. From then on your
phone buzzes when an agent **needs input**, when a **route completes or fails**, and
when a solo turn finishes — route hops are deliberately silent (a 5-step pipeline
buzzes once, not five times). Verify with `loom clients --ping`.

## Security model

- The daemon binds to `127.0.0.1` by default, or your **Tailscale interface** with
  `--tailnet` — never `0.0.0.0`. The tailnet is the trust boundary: device auth and E2E
  encryption come from Tailscale.
- Every request needs a bearer token (`~/.loom/daemon.json`, mode 0600).
- Pairing: `loom pair` mints a **short-lived (10 min), single-use** token, rendered as a
  QR. The device exchanges it for a long-lived client token. Secrets never ride in URLs.
- Paired clients are not admins: they can't mint new pairing tokens.

## Adapter SDK

Add an agent in ~40 lines — implement the contract, register the kind:

```ts
import { AdapterBase, registerAgentKind, type SendInput } from "threadloom/sdk";

class MyAgentAdapter extends AdapterBase {
  async available() { return true; }
  async start() {}
  async stop() {}
  async send(input: SendInput) {
    this._busy = true;
    try {
      // …drive your agent; stream progress:
      this.emit({ kind: "message", payload: { text: "done!" } });
      this.emit({ kind: "run_complete", payload: {} });
    } finally { this._busy = false; }
  }
  async interrupt() {}
}

registerAgentKind("my-agent", (cfg, dir) => new MyAgentAdapter(cfg.id, "my-agent", dir));
```

Full guide: [docs/adapters.md](docs/adapters.md). Design rationale and every decision
with its why: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Configuration

`.loom/config.json` (created by `loom init`, hot-reloaded on edit):

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "agents": [
    { "id": "claude-code", "kind": "claude-code", "role": "planner" },
    { "id": "opencode",    "kind": "opencode",    "role": "executor",
      "options": {} },
    { "id": "antigravity", "kind": "antigravity", "role": "general",
      "options": { "debugPort": 9222 } }
  ],
  "defaultAgent": "claude-code",
  "routes": { "ship": ["planner", "executor", "planner"] }
}
```

Roles: `planner` · `executor` · `reviewer` · `general`. Claude Code options:
`permissionMode` (default `acceptEdits`), `model`. OpenCode options:
`model` (`"providerID/modelID"`, e.g. `"opencode/minimax-m2.5"` — **set this**: headless
sessions don't inherit your TUI default), `agent`, `baseUrl` to reuse a running server.

## Development

```bash
npm test          # 173 tests: unit + full HTTP/WS end-to-end
npm run build     # tsc → dist/
npm run dev       # run the CLI from source (tsx)
```

## Environment

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `LOOM_HOME` | Where the registry, daemon config, and pair tokens live. Default `~/.loom`. Point it at a temp dir to try Loom without touching real state. |
| `LOOM_STORE` | `jsonl` forces the portable event store instead of `node:sqlite`. Loom falls back on its own if sqlite is unavailable; this makes it explicit. |
| `LOOM_NO_PTY` | `1` forces the pipe-backed shell instead of a real pty. CI runs the suite both ways. |
| `LOOM_NODE` | Node binary the desktop shell spawns the daemon with (Electron's own Node predates `node:sqlite`). |
| `LOOM_NO_NOTIFY` | `1` silences desktop notifications. |
| `LOOM_NO_PUSH` | `1` silences phone push. |
| `LOOM_ROUTE_STEP_TIMEOUT_MS` | Per-hop route timeout. Default 45 min. |

Going the other way, Loom **sets `LOOM_TERMINAL=1`** inside every terminal it opens, so
your shell profile can tell it's running in Loom's pane. (`LOOM_EXPO_PUSH_URL` and
`LOOM_TUI_SMOKE` also exist, but they're test plumbing — not configuration.)

## Roadmap

- Tasks beyond GitHub — GitLab and Linear sit disabled in the provider row today.
- More adapters/bridges via the SDK — contributions welcome.

## Design

Every Loom surface (web app, desktop shell, phone app) wears one design system —
**quiet graphite**: neutral monochrome chrome, hairline borders, Geist type, and
color reserved for state (thread cyan = live, shuttle magenta = the baton).
